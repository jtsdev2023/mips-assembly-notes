        <article>
          <p>
            When we write a program in assembly language we are creating a list
            of instructions that we want the processor to perform to accomplish
            some task (an algorithm). As soon as we have acquired a functional
            mode of the processor and know exactly what instructions the
            processor can perform, then we will have mastered the first
            necessary componment to becoming a MIPS assembly language
            programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The continuous step-by-step functional operation of our simplified
            model for the MIPS architecture can be described as:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              An instruction is fetched from memory at the location specified by
              the Program Counter. The instruction is loaded into the
              Instruction Register (IR). The Program Counter is incremented y 4.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two 5-bit codes <code>Rs</code> and <code>Rt</code> within the
              instruction specify which register file locations are accessed to
              obtain two 32-bit source operands.
            </li>
            <li>
              The two 32-bit source operands are routed to the ALU inputs where
              some operation is performed depending upon the Op-Code in the
              instruction.
            </li>
            <li>
              The result of the operation is placed back into the register file
              at a location specified by the 5-bit <code>Rd</code> code in the
              IR.
              <br />
              Go to step 1.
            </li>
          </ol>
